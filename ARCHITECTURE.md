 System Objectives

1. High Performance: Low-latency execution for real-time agent responses.
2. Modular Design: Clean decoupling between agent core, memory, tools, and user interface.
3. Observability: Built-in logging, token tracking, and step-by-step tracing.

 Module Breakdown

- `src/core/`: Agent orchestration and prompt state machine.
- `src/tools/`: Custom function tools and MCP adapters.
- `src/memory/`: Vector DB embeddings and session history.
- `src/api/`: REST/GraphQL endpoints for interface consumption.
- `tests/`: Automated unit and integration tests.

 Security & Guardrails

- Input sanitization and prompt injection protection.
- API Key secret isolation via environment variables.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on external tool execution.
